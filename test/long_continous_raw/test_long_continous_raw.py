"""Validate blink extraction on a full ``mne.Raw`` recording.

This module contains integration tests that reproduce the legacy workflow in
which ``ear_eog_raw.fif`` is processed without slicing the recording into 30 second
epochs.  Blink events are detected for the entire file and per-blink properties
are computed directly on the continuous data.  The expected blink count is
loaded from a CSV produced by the epoch-based pipeline for comparison.
