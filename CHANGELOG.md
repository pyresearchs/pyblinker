# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Extend epoch-level legacy morphology aggregation to compute `mean`, `std`, and `cv` for each legacy metric via the shared `_safe_stats` convention.

### Changed
- Refactor energy feature extraction orchestration to mirror morphology-style epoch/modality/channel delegation (`compute_energy_features -> _compute_epoch_record -> _compute_channel_record`), including per-modality style-window planning reused across channels.
- Refactor kinematics epoch aggregation to mirror morphology’s `compute -> _compute_epoch_record -> _compute_channel_record` call graph, including modality/style planning helpers and single per-channel/per-epoch blink-frame construction reused across style stats.
- Refactor energy, kinematics, and morphology feature schema/header generation into dedicated `column_headers.py` modules backed by a shared `blink_features/utils/column_headers_common.py` helper, while preserving legacy column names/order/alias behavior and existing feature computations.
- Refactor feature-family compute setup to use shared epoch-context utilities (`_epoch_context.py`) across energy, frequency-domain, and kinematics extractors.
- Remove temporary `test/blink_features/test_shared_refactor_helpers.py` helper script and keep validation through the canonical full-suite runner.
- Remove onset/duration-style discovery from shared style helpers and standardize on frame-based start/end metadata windows.
- Extract kinematics low-level numeric helper routines into `pyblinker/blink_features/kinematics/helpers.py` and consume them from the epoch extractor.
- Align EAR-only kinematics expected columns with threshold-interpolation landmarks (`th_interpolation`, `th_point`, and legacy ` interpolated_threshold`) and assert the full generated metric set via `build_expected_metrics`.
- Correct EAR-only kinematics expected-metric schema to use `modality="ear"` in `build_expected_metrics`, matching EAR feature column prefixes.
- Refactor EAR-only kinematics test to define `REQUIRED_KINEMATICS_METRICS` via `build_expected_metrics` and shared/style-suffixed metric generation for parity with EEG/EOG kinematics tests.
- Refactor EOG-only kinematics expected metric assertions to use `build_expected_metrics` with programmatic per-landmark shared/style-suffixed metric generation for `base`, `tent`, and `zero`.
- Refactor EEG-only kinematics test expected metric construction to generate shared and style-suffixed metrics programmatically, reducing duplication while preserving expected columns.
- Refactor epoch-level energy feature aggregation to use modality-aware style segmentation windows (EEG/EOG style landmarks and EAR threshold-interpolation windows) instead of deprecated onset/duration windowing.
- Refactor frequency-domain wavelet epoch aggregation to use channel-aware frame-based segmentation windows (EEG/EOG style landmarks plus `half`/`peak` aliases, and EAR threshold interpolation mapped to `th_point`) instead of deprecated onset/duration windows.
- Rename aggregated legacy morphology outputs to the new fully qualified naming format (`{modality}__{style}__morphology__{metric}_{stat}__{channel}`) for EEG/EOG legacy metric exports.
- Update morphology integration tests to assert the new legacy naming convention with mean/std/cv variants in full-modality and EEG-only coverage.
- Add shared refactor scaffolding for blink features: `BlinkerConfig`/`DEFAULT_CONFIG`, shared constants, style-window helpers, and a reusable compute skeleton module.
- Preserve legacy DataFrame-column compatibility by forcing object-typed column indexes in feature outputs used by baseline regression pickles.
- Harden optional wavelet dependency behavior so missing `PyWavelets` now degrades gracefully with warnings and NaN outputs instead of import-time failure.
- Align morphology epoch feature extraction with shared `_epoch_context` setup utilities and deduplicate energy/frequency-domain window parsing through new `pyblinker/blink_features/_style_windows.py`.

### Fixed
- Restore baseline-compatible EAR style-window precedence for frequency-domain aggregation (`th_interpolation` preferred over `th_point`) and restore morphology style discovery behavior in epoch aggregation after the shared-context refactor.
- Remove style-priority window fallback from morphology blink-landmark frame building so `_build_blink_landmark_frame` no longer derives `max_blink`/`max_value` from style windows when no explicit peak metadata is present.
- Emit an actionable runtime warning when required legacy morphology columns are missing from `blink_df`, including the missing column names and guidance to review `_REQUIRED_LEGACY_MORPHOLOGY_METRICS`.

### Removed
- Remove deprecated `pyblinker/outside_annotation/` modules from the core package.
- Remove temporary morphology regression test `test_morphology_refine_window_selection.py` and rely on existing morphology suite coverage.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- Avoid `TypeError` in morphology epoch aggregation when a modality/channel has no detected blinks by returning an empty legacy-metrics mapping instead of `None`.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- Correct EEG-only kinematics expected-column generation in `test_kinematics_eeg_only_config.py` by mapping style-specific metrics to the appropriate landmarks (`base`, `tent`, and `zero`) so the test no longer asserts impossible column combinations.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- Emit legacy EOG morphology metrics even when EEG channels are also present, restoring expected combined-modality morphology columns in `test_morphology_ear_eeg_eog.py`.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- Preserve the original EOG channel label casing in epoch energy and frequency-domain feature column names, while keeping non-EOG channel labels uppercased for backward-compatible EAR/EEG outputs.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- Replace deprecated MNE `pick_channels(...)` usage with `pick(...)` in blinker-vs-pyblinker comparison tests to remove legacy warning noise during unittest execution (including `test_b_fitblink`).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- Update all blinker-vs-pyblinker comparison tests to import and call `get_test_file_path(...)`, preserving both per-file pytest execution and aggregate unittest execution via `test/run_all_tests.py`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- Make `test/blinker_pyblinker_comparison` path handling discovery-safe by resolving test fixture files relative to the test package instead of the process working directory.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- Fix morphology style-window extraction to prioritize frame-based landmark boundaries (`start__...`/`end__...`) over onset/duration metadata so per-window metrics no longer collapse to empty windows when duration fields are zero.
- Update morphology per-window metric extraction to slice `signal[start_frame:end_frame]` directly from frame windows (without round-tripping through onset/duration conversion).
- Add regression coverage ensuring `zero` style windows are built from landmark frame indices when present.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-02-11
