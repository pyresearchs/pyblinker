# Changelog

## [0.1.9] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- Correct `get_blink_statistic` to report `number_blinks` from the full blink-fit table (matching MATLAB `extractBlinks`), while still excluding invalid rows for downstream quality/cutoff statistics.
- This restores MATLAB-parity for blink statistics and makes the blinker comparison tests pass consistently when run individually or through the aggregate runner.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- Align `get_blink_statistic` with MATLAB `extractBlinks` semantics by dropping invalid blink-fit rows before all downstream statistics and mask calculations.
- Match MATLAB blink amplitude ratio masking behavior with inclusive zero-crossing ranges and robust handling of empty inside/outside positive-signal samples.
- Return deterministic NaN-based statistics when fewer than two top-threshold blink fits are available, mirroring MATLAB early-exit behavior for cutoff statistics.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- Stabilize FitBlinks correlation outputs (`leftR2`, `rightR2`) for MATLAB comparison by normalizing returned R values to single-precision representation.
- Relax strict floating-point equality in `step_b_fitblink.py` to MATLAB-appropriate absolute tolerance (`atol=1e-6`) to avoid false failures from numeric noise.


## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- Restore MATLAB-consistent left half-height landmark indexing in FitBlinks geometry (base and zero half-height frames).
- Restore MATLAB-consistent inter-blink max-velocity fields used by BlinkProperties comparison outputs.
- Guard amplitude-velocity ratio velocity-index bounds to avoid out-of-range indexing on short boundary blinks.


## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- Refactor blink-position detection and blink-property extraction flows into MATLAB-aligned helper stages for clearer parity-oriented maintenance.

### Fixed
- Align blink start/end candidate scanning and minimum-separation masking with MATLAB `getBlinkPositions` semantics.
- Correct baseline and half-height landmark indexing offsets used during FitBlinks geometry calculations to match MATLAB frame conventions.
- Fix inter-blink maximum-velocity interval computation so BlinkProperties uses MATLAB-style successive-peak differences.


## [0.1.4] - 2026-01-20

### Changed
- Expand blink-property metric definitions and MATLAB-to-Python column mapping documentation.

### Fixed
- Align blink-property timing, shut-time defaults, and inter-blink velocity intervals with MATLAB to support row-by-row comparisons.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-01-19

### Changed
- Render FitBlinks tutorial waveforms as scatter points with a faint line trace behind them and pad report windows on the left by 10 samples for clearer landmark visibility.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed
- Resolve FitBlinks tutorial input paths relative to the repository and write reports to the tutorial_outputs folder.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-18

### Added
- Add MATLAB FitBlinks HTML reporting utilities to compare MATLAB output with Python-derived landmarks using consistent plotting and captions.

## [0.0.74] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- Keep FitBlinks y-intersect comparison values in signal units without indexing offsets.

## [0.0.73] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- Adjust FitBlinks comparison indexing so y-intersect values remain in signal units.

## [0.0.72] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- Align FitBlinks comparison indexing for intersection outputs without extra y-intersect offset.

## [0.0.71] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- Emit NaN half-height landmarks when thresholds are never crossed to match MATLAB fit behavior.

## [0.0.70] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- Correct right-base index handling in FitBlinks to match MATLAB downstroke minima behavior.

## [0.0.69] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- Align FitBlinks indexing, baseline selection, and line-intersection handling with MATLAB to preserve blink counts and fit outputs.

## [0.0.68] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- Match MATLAB blink position separation handling by allowing candidates exactly at the minimum separation threshold.

### Changed
- Refactor blink position detection into vectorized helpers for improved efficiency without altering behavior.

## [0.0.67] - 2026-01-15

### Changed
- Compute morphology epoch metrics with shared core duration/shut-time helpers while emitting both legacy flat column names and fully-qualified style-aware names.
- Replace lazy morphology package exports with explicit imports aligned to the kinematics package.
- Add morphology aggregation logging and clarify core metric responsibilities in documentation strings.
- Refactor morphology epoch extraction into helper steps with pipeline-oriented docstrings.

### Added
- EEG-only morphology test coverage for style-aware duration columns and legacy aliases.

## [0.0.66] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed
- Draw EEG epoch landmark markers behind EEG scatter points in the EEG landmark tutorial to keep EEG-E8 dots on top without changing marker sizes.
