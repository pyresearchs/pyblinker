# pyblinker
`pyblinker` is a Python package primarily intended for automated detection of eye-blink artifacts in diverse biosignals, 
including electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR). It addresses the limitations of 
existing MATLAB-based tools like [BLINKER](https://github.com/VisLab/EEG-Blinks), 
offering a Python-based, open-source solution for researchers analyzing various types of physiological data.

A key benefit of `pyblinker` is its enhanced functionality and broader applicability compared to `BLINKER`.  
By expanding input compatibility beyond EEG/EOG to include EAR, and by integrating seamlessly with the MNE-Python ecosystem, 
`pyblinker` provides a more versatile and accessible tool. This facilitates efficient and reproducible biosignal analysis 
workflows across neuroscience and related fields, ultimately streamlining research and improving data quality.

# Features
`pyblinker` provide a wide variety of tools to use including:

* Extraction of eye blinks from EEG, EOG, and EAR data.
* Compatibility with both continuous and epoch-based datasets.
* Support for single-channel and multi-channel signals.
* Computation of blink characteristics such as amplitude, duration, and peak-to-peak interval.
* Per-epoch feature extraction, including EAR metrics, energy complexity, frequency-domain measures, blink morphology, and waveform features.
* Generation of blink time series for visualization and validation.


# Contributing
Contributions are welcome (more than welcome!). Contributions can be feature requests, improved documentation, bug reports, 
code improvements, new code, etc. Anything will be appreciated. Note: this package adheres to the same contribution standards as MNE.

legacy MATLAB logic so that results remain comparable when migrating existing
workflows.
